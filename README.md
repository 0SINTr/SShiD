## 🔍 **Overview**

**SShiD** is a proof-of-concept, Linux-based tool that utilizes principles of **network steganography** and enables covert communication by embedding encrypted messages within Wi-Fi beacon frames' **Vendor-Specific Information Elements (IEs)**. This method allows for discreet data transmission without establishing a traditional network connection.

🍀 **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Covert Communication:** Transmit messages without active network connections.
- **Encryption:** Utilizes ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for secure message transmission.
- **Custom SSID Generation:** Creates unique SSIDs based on a shared secret password.
- **Vendor-Specific IEs:** Embeds messages within standard-compliant beacon frames.
- **Channel Specification:** Operates on a user-defined Wi-Fi channel (default is 1).

## 💪 **Advantages**

- **Stealthy Transmission:** By leveraging beacon frames, communication remains passive and less detectable.
- **No Network Association Required:** Devices can exchange information without connecting to an access point.
- **No Single Point of Failure:** Communication cannot be filtered by a firewall or IDS system.
- **Standard Compliance:** Uses Wi-Fi standards, enhancing compatibility with various devices.
- **Encryption Security:** Ensures messages remain confidential and tamper-proof.

- **Reliability of using beacon frames for the communication flow.**
  - For the sake of blending our covert traffic into the overall traffic, keep in mind that **communication via SShiD will not always be 100% reliable**. Since we're using broadcast messages over Wi-Fi, there's always a chance that packets can be lost due to network congestion, wireless interference, or other factors. Message retries are planned for **future versions**.

## 🛠️ **Architecture**

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Speaker:** Broadcasts beacon frames containing encrypted messages.
2. **Listener:** Sniffs beacon frames and extracts the hidden messages.

Both components use a shared secret password for SSID generation and message encryption/decryption.

## 🔄 **Communication Flow**

Make sure that the **Listener** is running and listening *prior* to executing the **Speaker** script.

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Speaker and Listener** share a secret password before using **SShiD**.
   - Both set their wireless interfaces to monitor mode (see commands below).

2. **SSID Generation:**
   - The **Speaker** generates a unique SSID by hashing the password.
   - This SSID serves as an identifier for the Listener.
   - The Listener derives the same SSID from the password.

3. **Message Encryption:**
   - The **Speaker** encrypts the message using ChaCha20-Poly1305 with a key derived from the password.

4. **Beacon Frame Construction:**
   - The **Speaker** constructs a beacon frame with:
     - The generated SSID.
     - The encrypted message embedded in a Vendor-Specific IE.
     - Standard IEs like RSN information for compliance.

5. **Broadcasting:**
   - The **Speaker** broadcasts a set of 50 beacon frames.

6. **Packet Capturing:**
   - The **Listener** captures beacon frames in monitor mode.
   - Captures only frames matching the unique SSID.

7. **Message Extraction:**
   - The **Listener** extracts the encrypted message from the Vendor-Specific IE.
   - Decrypts the message using the shared password.

8. **Output:**
   - The decrypted message is displayed to the user.
   - Broadcasting and listening are turned off.

🍀 **NOTE:** **SShiD** enables **one-to-many** communication between the **Speaker** and any **Listener** who knows the password. Therefore, the message exchange is **not** bidirectional.

## 🕵 **System Requirements**

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali)
  - Latest release tested and functional on **Ubuntu 24.04**
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:**
  - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing
  - `cryptography` for encryption and decryption
- **Privileges:** Root or sudo access to send or sniff WiFi beacons
- **Network Interface:** Wireless interfaces in **UP** state and **Monitor** mode. **SShiD** will automatically detect and prompt you to select the active interface if multiple are detected.

## 🖥️ **Monitor Mode**

Monitor mode should be enabled on **both** the Speaker and Listener machines prior to using **SShiD**.
To identify your wireless interface and check if it supports Monitor mode use:
```bash
iw dev
sudo iw list | grep -A 10 "Supported interface modes"
```

To **enable Monitor mode** (assuming `wlan0` is your interface) use:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```
After enabling Monitor mode, check with `iwconfig` to see if your interface shows **Mode: Monitor**.

Some WiFi cards may show support for Monitor mode but not function properly, for instance when capturing frames. 

To check your **wireless adapter driver** use:
```bash
lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i network
```
or, for **USB adapters**:
```bash
lsusb
```

Additionally, **check logs** for failure messages if your adapter doesn't capture any traffic at all in Monitor mode.
```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i <driver_name>
```

🍀 **NOTE:** Do your own research on your adapter and any issues related to Monitor mode. Best case scenario, you need a driver update. Otherwise, you need an adapter that supports Monitor mode. The cheapest option may be **TP-Link TL-WN722N**. Here's a tutorial on how to set it up to allow Monitor mode:
- [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzfQAtndtLI)

To **disable Monitor mode** and re-enable the default **Managed mode**:
```bash
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type managed
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
```

## ⚒️ **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0SINTr/SShiD.git
   cd SShiD
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-scapy
   sudo apt install python3-cryptography
   ```

## ⛑️ **Usage**

Both Speaker and Listener scripts require root privileges to send or sniff beacons. You can run the scripts using `sudo`:

**Speaker:**
   ```
   sudo python3 speaker.py
   ```

**Listener:**
   ```
   sudo python3 listener.py
   ```

## 🚫 Limitations
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Requires wireless adapters that support monitor mode and packet injection.
- **Range Constraints**: Effective communication range is limited to Wi-Fi transmission distances.
- **Legal Compliance**: Users must comply with local laws and regulations regarding wireless transmissions.

## 🎯 Planned Upgrades
- [X] Improved CLI experience
- [ ] More testing is needed
